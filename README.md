# ChatGPT Plugin for Hexabot Chatbot Builder

The ChatGPT Plugin integrates OpenAI’s ChatGPT model with Hexabot chatbot workflows to enable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities. This plugin allows users to enrich their chatbot responses using relevant content retrieved from a content management system, making interactions more contextual and accurate.

[Hexabot](https://hexabot.ai/) is an open-source chatbot / agent solution that allows users to create and manage AI-powered, multi-channel, and multilingual chatbots with ease. If you would like to learn more, please visit the [official github repo](https://github.com/Hexastack/Hexabot/).

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the ChatGPT Plugin, you will need to generate an API token from OpenAI.

1. Go to the [OpenAI API page](https://openai.com/api).
2. Obtain your API key.
3. Once you have your API key, you can configure the plugin in Hexabot.

## Installation

First, navigate to your Hexabot project directory and make sure the dependencies are installed:

```sh
cd ~/projects/Hexabot
npm install
```

To install the ChatGPT Plugin, run the following command:

```sh
npx hexabot install plugin Hexastack/hexabot-plugin-chatgpt
```

## Configuration

The ChatGPT Plugin provides several customizable settings that can be configured through the Hexabot admin interface:

- **Token**: Your OpenAI API token. This is required for authentication.
- **Model**: The model to be used for generating responses (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`).
- **Response Size**: The maximum number of tokens in the AI response.
- **Messages to Retrieve**: The number of recent messages to include as context when making requests to OpenAI.
- **Context**: A description or context of the chatbot’s role to guide its responses.
- **Instructions**: Custom instructions for how the AI should handle responses based on your use case.

## How to Use

1. Access the Hexabot Visual Editor.
2. Drag the ChatGPT RAG block from "Custom Blocks" onto the canvas.
3. Double-click the block to edit and configure the plugin’s settings, including the API token, model, and context.

## Example

Here’s an example prompt generated by the plugin when sending a request to OpenAI:

```

CONTEXT: You are an AI Chatbot that works for Hexastack, an organization that provides AI-powered solutions. Use the following information to assist users:
